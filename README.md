# Hotel Ordering and Bill Generating System

This project is a **Hotel Ordering and Bill Generating System** developed to enhance my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Java Collection Frameworks**. The system allows a restaurant to take orders from customers, organize them by table number, and generate a bill for each table.

## Features
- **Table Management**: Assigns and manages orders based on table numbers.
- **Order Management**: Allows placing multiple orders per table and storing them in a structured way.
- **Bill Generation**: Generates the total bill for each table based on the items ordered.
- **Java Collection Framework**: Utilizes data structures like `ArrayList` to store and manipulate orders efficiently.

## OOP Concepts Applied
- **Encapsulation**: The system uses classes to encapsulate data such as menu items, tables, and orders.
- **Inheritance**: Common behaviors are extracted into base classes to promote reusability and inheritance.
- **Polymorphism**: Different types of menu items and orders are handled through polymorphism where required.
- **Abstraction**: Abstracted complex logic into well-defined methods to make the system easy to maintain and extend.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core language used for development.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Development environment used for coding and testing.
- **Git**: Version control system to manage project updates.
- **GitHub**: Code repository for collaboration and version management.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vamsi141002-coder/hotel-ordering-system.git

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE.
3. Run the Main.java file.
4. The system will prompt for table numbers and allow you to place orders.
5. When done, it will generate a bill based on the table number requested.
## Sample Usage
1. Assign a Table: Enter a table number to start ordering.
2. Take Orders: Input menu items for each table and store the order.
3. Print Bill: Enter a table number to generate the total bill for the table.
## Future Enhancements
1. Add support for handling special offers and discounts.
2. Implement more advanced data structures for order optimization.
3. Improve the UI for better user experience.
